= NetBadge

== Description of how it all works

Apache is setup to intercept requests at /sessions/netbadge under HTTPS

** So all requests to that url must be HTTPS if Apache is to kick in it's NetBadge magic.

If Apache doesn't find a valid cookie, the request is redirected to the NetBadge auth. server.

User performs login at NetBadge server

With a successful login, the NetBadge auth. server redirects back to the original location: /sessions/netbadge

But with a REMOTE_USER variable (among other things)

...

This time, the Rails app handles the request

The :netbadge action attemps to find a User like: User.find_by_netbadgeid==REMOTE_USER

If found, the current_user is set (user.id stored in session) and the user is redirected to the /me url == DONE

If the User is not registered, they're forwarded to the signup page with their info pre-populated with netbadge data

=======================

NOTE: Passwords are not required for NetBadge users

The only location that needs to be under SSL is /sessions/netbadge; Apache requires this
